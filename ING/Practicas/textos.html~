The ability of tiny computing devices to control complex operations
has transformed the way many tasks are performed, ranging from
scientific research to producing consumer products. Tiny computers on
a chip are used in medical equipment, home appliances, cars and
toys. Workers use handheld computing devices to collect data at a
customer´s site, to generate forms, to control inventory, and to serve
as desktop organizers.
</p>

<p>
Not only is computing equipment getting smaller, it is getting more
sophisticated. Computers are part of many machines and devices that
once required continual human supervision and control. Today,
computers in security systems result in safer environments, computers
in cars improve energy efficiency, and computers in phones provide
features such as call forwarding, call monitoring, and call
answering.
</p>

<p>
These smart machines are designed to take over some of the basic tasks
previously performed by people; by so doing, they make life a little
easier and a little more pleasant. Smart cards store vital information
such as health records, driver’s licenses, bank balances, and so
on. Smart phones, cars, and appliances with built-in computers can be
programmed to better meet individual needs. A smart house has built-in
monitoring systems that can turn lights on and off, open and close
windows, operate the oven, and more.
</p>

<p>
With small computing devices available for performing smart tasks like
cooking dinner, programming the VCR, and controlling the flow of
information in an organization, people are able to spend more time
doing what they often do best – being creative. Computers can help
people work more creatively.

Multimedia systems are known for their educational and entertainment
value, which we call ‘edutainment’. Multimedia combines text with
sound, video, animation, and graphics, which greatly enhances the
interaction between user and machine and can make information more
interesting and appealing to people. Expert systems software enables
computer to ‘think’ like experts. Medical diagnose expert systems, for
example, can help doctors pinpoint a patient’s illness, suggest
further tests, and prescribe appropriate drugs.
</p>

<p>
Connectivity enables computers and software that might otherwise be
incompatible to communicate and to share resources. Now that computers
are proliferating in many areas and networks are available for people
to access data and communicate with others, personal computers are
becoming interpersonal PCs. They have the potential to significantly
improve the way we relate to each other. Many people today telecommute
that is, use their computers to stay in touch with the office while
they are working at home. With the proper tools, hospital staff can
get diagnosis from a medical expert hundreds or thousands of miles
away. Similarly, the disabled can communicate more effectively with
others using computers.
</p>

<p>
Distance learning and videoconferencing are concepts made possible
with the use of an electronic classroom or boardroom accessible to
people in remote locations. Vast databases of information are
currently available to users of the internet, all of whom can send
email messages to each other. The information superhighway is designed
to significantly expand this interactive connectivity so that people
all over the world will have free access to all these resources.
</p>

<p>
People power is critical to ensuring that hardware, software, and
connectivity are effectively integrated in a socially responsible
way. People – computer users and computer professionals –are ones who
will decide which hardware, software and networks endure and how great
and impact they will have on our lives. Ultimately people power must
be exercised to ensure that computers are used not only efficiently
but in a socially responsible way.

According to new research, learning a second language can slow
cognitive ageing, that is, the speed at which the mental activity of
the brain diminishes. This seems to happen not only in young learners
but also in those who have learnt a new language in their
adulthood. Previous studies had already shown that becoming
functionally bilingual could delay the apparition of elderly demetia
by several years, but the aim of Dr Thomas Bak´s studies was to answer
the question of whether people improve their brain function through
learning new languages , or whether people with better brain functions
are more likely to become bilingual.
</p>

<p>
Dr Bak´s team assessed data from 835 native English speakers. These
people had passed an intelligence test in 1947 when they were just 11
years old, and were given a new test in their early 70s. Of the
participants, nearly one third said that they could communicate in at
least another language apart from English. Of those, one out of three
admitted they had learnt the new language/s when they were adults.
</p>

<p>
Researchers said that participants who spoke two or more languages
showed better cognitive abilities than the results from the first
long-ago tests had anticipated. Nevermind if people had been young or
adult language learners. Dr Bak said that the improvements could not
be attributed to the participants´ original intelligence levels and
added: "These findings are relevant as millions of people around
the world acquire a second language later in life. The results show
that being able to use different languages, even when you have started
later in your life, is beneficial against brain ageing.
